# Robot Control Screen - Refactored Architecture

## 🎯 Overview

The robot control screen has been completely refactored from a monolithic 1,500+ line file into a modular, maintainable architecture. This refactoring improves code organization, reduces complexity, and makes the codebase much easier to debug and extend.

## 🧩 Component Architecture

### UI Components (`components/`)

Each component is a self-contained widget that handles a specific UI concern:

1. **`bluetooth_section.dart`**
   - Handles device discovery and connection UI
   - Displays paired devices list
   - Shows connection status and progress
   - Provides connection tips and troubleshooting

2. **`connection_status_section.dart`**
   - Shows current connection status
   - Displays connected device info
   - Provides visual feedback for connection state

3. **`control_mode_selector.dart`**
   - Toggles between driving and arm control modes
   - Updates UI state based on selected mode
   - Provides clear mode indication

4. **`joystick_control_section.dart`**
   - Tank drive controls with left/right motor speeds
   - Directional buttons for movement
   - Speed preset buttons for quick control
   - Real-time speed display

5. **`pose_control_section.dart`**
   - Predefined pose buttons (Home, Rest, Grab, etc.)
   - Visual icons for each pose
   - Quick arm positioning controls

6. **`quick_actions_section.dart`**
   - Emergency stop button
   - Home position button
   - Motor test function
   - Diagnostics toggle

7. **`servo_control_section.dart`**
   - Individual servo angle sliders
   - Real-time angle display
   - Configurable servo names
   - Range validation

8. **`speed_control_section.dart`**
   - Global speed multiplier slider
   - Percentage display
   - Range: 20% to 100%

9. **`video_feed_section.dart`**
   - MJPEG video stream display
   - Connection status indicators
   - Refresh controls
   - Error handling and fallback UI

### Service Layer (`services/`)

Service classes handle business logic and external integrations:

1. **`video_service.dart`**
   - Manages video stream URLs
   - Tests video connectivity
   - Handles stream state management
   - Provides error handling

2. **`robot_control_service.dart`**
   - Generates robot commands
   - Validates command parameters
   - Provides default configurations
   - Handles command formatting

3. **`orientation_service.dart`**
   - Manages screen orientation switching
   - Portrait mode for Bluetooth connection
   - Landscape mode for robot control
   - Handles orientation restoration

4. **`bluetoth_service.dart`**
   - Cross-platform Bluetooth abstraction
   - Device discovery and connection
   - Permission handling
   - Connection monitoring
